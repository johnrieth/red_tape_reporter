# Security Improvements - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) - ENABLED
**Problem:** CSP was disabled, leaving site vulnerable to XSS attacks  
**Solution:** Enabled CSP with nonce-based inline script protection

### 2. ✅ Admin Authorization - VERIFIED
**Status:** Already properly implemented and working

---

## Quick Verification

### Test CSP is Working

**In your browser:**
1. Open https://redtape.la
2. Open DevTools → Console
3. Look for NO CSP violation errors
4. Verify Plausible analytics loads (check Network tab)

**Command line:**
```bash
curl -I https://redtape.la | grep "Content-Security-Policy"
```

### Test Admin Authorization

**Unauthorized access (should be blocked):**
1. Create non-admin user or sign out
2. Try to visit `/admin/reports`
3. Should redirect to home with "Access denied" alert

**Authorized access (should work):**
1. Sign in as admin user
2. Visit `/admin/reports`
3. Should show admin dashboard

---

## Create Your First Admin User

```bash
# SSH into production server, then:
rails console

User.create!(
  email_address: "your-email@example.com",
  password: "your-secure-password",
  admin: true
)
```

**Important:** Store this password securely!

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

**CSP Configuration:**
- `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` - Enabled CSP

**Views (removed inline styles):**
- `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` - Added CSP nonces
- `app/views/reports/success.html.erb`
- `app/views/shared/_footer.html.erb`
- `app/views/admin/reports/index.html.erb`

**Stylesheets (added utility classes):**
- `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`
- `app/assets/stylesheets/admin.css`

### What CSP Allows

✅ Your own scripts and styles  
✅ Google Fonts  
✅ Plausible.io analytics  
✅ HTTPS resources  
❌ Inline scripts (without nonce)  
❌ Inline styles (moved to CSS classes)  
❌ eval() and similar unsafe functions

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy to staging first** (if available)
2. **Test everything:**
   - [ ] Home page loads
   - [ ] Report submission form works
   - [ ] Email verification works
   - [ ] Admin dashboard accessible (with admin user)
   - [ ] Non-admin blocked from admin area
   - [ ] Plausible analytics working
   - [ ] No CSP errors in console
3. **Monitor logs** for CSP violations
4. **Deploy to production**

---

## If Something Breaks

### Temporarily disable CSP enforcement

Edit `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`:

```ruby
# Change from enforcement mode to report-only mode
config.content_security_policy_report_only = true
```

This will log violations without blocking content.

### Check for CSP violations

```bash
# In production logs
tail -f log/production.log | grep -i "csp"

# Or in browser DevTools → Console
# Look for messages starting with: "Content Security Policy"
```

### Common Issues

**Problem:** Plausible analytics not loading  
**Solution:** Check that script has nonce attribute in layout

**Problem:** Styles not applying  
**Solution:** Verify CSS classes exist in stylesheets

**Problem:** Admin can't access dashboard  
**Solution:** Verify user has `admin: true` in database
