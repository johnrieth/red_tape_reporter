# Staging Environment Setup Guide

## Do You Need Staging?

**Short answer:** Not necessarily! For a small project like Red Tape LA, testing locally is often sufficient.

**When to use staging:**
- You want to test with production-like infrastructure (SSL, domain, etc.)
- You want to test email delivery with real domains
- You have a team and want a shared testing environment
- You want to test deployments before going to production

**When local testing is fine:**
- Solo developer (you!)
- Changes are low-risk (like the CSP/security changes we just made)
- You have good test coverage
- Quick iteration is more important than perfect replication

## Option 1: Test Locally (Recommended for Now)

This is the fastest and easiest way to test the security changes:

### Step 1: Start Your Local Server

```bash
# From project directory
cd red_tape_reporter

# Install dependencies (if needed)
bundle install

# Start the server
rails server
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Step 2: Create a Test Admin User

```bash
# In another terminal
EMAIL=admin@test.com PASSWORD=password123 rails admin:create
```

### Step 3: Test Everything

**Test CSP is working:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Browse around the site
4. Look for CSP errors â†’ Should be NONE
5. Check Network tab â†’ Plausible should load from plausible.io

**Test report submission:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Share Your Story"
3. Fill out the form
4. Submit
5. Check terminal for email delivery logs

**Test admin authorization:**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/session/new
2. Log in with admin@test.com / password123
3. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/reports â†’ Should work
4. Log out
5. Try to access http://localhost:3000/admin/reports â†’ Should redirect with "Access denied"

**Test as non-admin:**
```bash
# Create regular user (not admin)
EMAIL=user@test.com PASSWORD=password123 rails runner "User.create!(email_address: 'user@test.com', password: 'password123', admin: false)"
```

1. Log in as user@test.com
2. Try to access /admin/reports â†’ Should be blocked

### Step 4: Run Tests

```bash
# Run test suite
rails test

# Run security scan
bundle exec brakeman

# Check for any rubocop issues (optional)
bundle exec rubocop
```

If everything works locally, **you're ready to deploy to production!**

## Option 2: Set Up a Staging Server (Advanced)

Only do this if you really want a staging environment.

### Prerequisites

You need:
- A second server (can be smaller/cheaper than production)
- A subdomain for staging (e.g., staging.redtape.la)
- SSH access to the staging server
- Docker installed on staging server

### Step 1: Get a Staging Server

**Option A: Same Hetzner account**
- Create another server (CX11 is fine - $4/month)
- Use same SSH key as production
- Note the IP address

**Option B: Use existing server on different port**
- Can deploy to same server as production
- Different container name (`red_tape_reporter_staging`)
- Different port mapping

**Option C: Use a free/cheap service**
- Render.com free tier
- Railway.app free tier
- Fly.io free tier

### Step 2: DNS Setup

Add a subdomain pointing to your staging server:

```
staging.redtape.la  â†’  A record  â†’  YOUR_STAGING_SERVER_IP
```

Wait for DNS to propagate (can take a few minutes to 24 hours).

### Step 3: Create Staging Credentials

```bash
# Create staging credentials
EDITOR=vim rails credentials:edit --environment staging
```

Add your Resend API key:
```yaml
resend:
  api_key: re_YourResendApiKey_Here
```

Save and exit. This creates:
- `config/credentials/staging.yml.enc` (safe to commit)
- `config/credentials/staging.key` (DO NOT COMMIT)

### Step 4: Update Staging Deploy Config

Edit `config/deploy.staging.yml`:

```yaml
servers:
  web:
    - YOUR_STAGING_SERVER_IP  # Replace with actual IP

proxy:
  host: staging.redtape.la  # Your staging subdomain
```

### Step 5: Update Kamal Secrets

Edit `.kamal/secrets` and add staging secrets:

```bash
# Existing production secrets
KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=your_github_token
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=your_production_master_key

# Add staging secrets
STAGING_RAILS_MASTER_KEY=paste_content_of_config_credentials_staging_key_here
```

Update `.kamal/secrets` to use the staging key when deploying to staging:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Decide which environment based on config file being used
if [ "$KAMAL_CONFIG" = "config/deploy.staging.yml" ]; then
  echo "RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$STAGING_RAILS_MASTER_KEY"
else
  echo "RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$RAILS_MASTER_KEY"
fi

echo "KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD"
```

### Step 6: Deploy to Staging

```bash
# First time setup
kamal setup -d staging

# Or regular deploy
kamal deploy -d staging
```

The `-d staging` flag tells Kamal to use `config/deploy.staging.yml`.

### Step 7: Create Staging Admin User

```bash
# Access staging console
kamal app exec -d staging --interactive "bin/rails console"

# In the console:
User.create!(
  email_address: "admin@example.com",
  password: "staging_password",
  admin: true
)
```

### Step 8: Test on Staging

Visit https://staging.redtape.la and test everything:

- [ ] Site loads with valid SSL
- [ ] No CSP errors in browser console
- [ ] Can submit reports
- [ ] Verification emails arrive
- [ ] Admin can access /admin/reports
- [ ] Non-admin blocked from admin area
- [ ] Plausible analytics loads

### Staging Commands Reference

```bash
# Deploy to staging
kamal deploy -d staging

# View staging logs
kamal app logs -d staging -f

# Access staging console
kamal app exec -d staging --interactive "bin/rails console"

# SSH into staging server
kamal app exec -d staging --interactive "bash"

# Restart staging app
kamal app restart -d staging

# Check staging status
kamal app details -d staging
```

## Recommended Approach for Security Changes

For the CSP and admin authorization changes we just made:

1. **Test locally first** (Option 1)
   - Fastest and easiest
   - Catches 95% of issues
   - No extra infrastructure needed

2. **Review the changes**
   - Look at the code changes
   - Understand what CSP does
   - Verify admin auth logic

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   rails test
   bundle exec brakeman
   ```

4. **Deploy to production**
   - These changes are low-risk
   - No database migrations
   - Easily reversible if needed

5. **Monitor after deployment**
   ```bash
   # Watch production logs
   kamal app logs -f
   
   # Check for CSP violations
   kamal app logs | grep -i "csp"
   ```

6. **Have a rollback plan**
   - If issues arise, disable CSP temporarily:
   ```ruby
   # config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb
   config.content_security_policy_report_only = true
   ```
   - Redeploy with `kamal deploy`

## Cost Comparison

**Local Testing:**
- Cost: $0
- Time to setup: 2 minutes
- Good enough for: 90% of changes

**Staging Server:**
- Cost: $4-10/month (Hetzner CX11, DigitalOcean droplet, etc.)
- Time to setup: 30-60 minutes
- Good enough for: Testing with real SSL, emails, domains

**My Recommendation:**

For your current security changes:
1. Test locally (5 minutes)
2. Deploy to production (5 minutes)
3. Monitor logs (5 minutes)

Total time: 15 minutes vs. 1+ hour to set up staging.

Save staging setup for when you:
- Have paying customers
- Need to test complex infrastructure changes
- Have a team that needs a shared environment
- Are making risky database migrations

## Quick Start: Test Now

The absolute fastest way to verify your changes are ready:

```bash
# 1. Start server
rails server

# 2. Open browser to http://localhost:3000

# 3. Check console (F12) for errors â†’ Should see none

# 4. Create admin user
EMAIL=admin@test.com PASSWORD=test123 rails admin:create

# 5. Test admin login at http://localhost:3000/session/new

# 6. Run tests
rails test
```

If all that works â†’ **Deploy to production!**

```bash
# Deploy
kamal deploy

# Watch logs
kamal app logs -f

# Test live site
curl -I https://redtape.la | grep "Content-Security-Policy"
```

Done! ðŸŽ‰

## Questions?

- **Should I set up staging?** Probably not needed right now. Test locally.
- **Is local testing enough?** Yes, for these security changes.
- **When should I set up staging?** When you have complex infrastructure or a team.
- **What if something breaks?** Disable CSP temporarily and redeploy.
