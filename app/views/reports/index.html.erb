  <!-- What We Do -->
  <section class="section">
    <p class="text-large">
      Red Tape LA collects firsthand accounts of problems in LA's building process. 
      We're documenting delays, unclear requirements, conflicting information, and 
      unnecessary costs across permits, inspections, zoning, fees, and more.
    </p>
    <p class="text-large">
      When patterns become visible, they become harder to ignore. Your story helps 
      build the case for change.
    </p>
    <p class="text-large">
      <strong>This is a new, volunteer project.</strong> I'm John Rieth, an LA 
      resident who started this because everyone complains about red tape, but no 
      one was systematically documenting it. I can't promise your individual issue 
      will be resolved, but I can promise your experience will be documented and 
      used to push for reform with city officials.
