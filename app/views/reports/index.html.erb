      <p class="text-large">
        LA's housing bureaucracy is broken. Everyone knows it, but no one's been tracking it systematically.
      </p>
      <p class="text-large">
        We're collecting real experiences from people trying to build housing in LA. Permit delays. Conflicting requirements. Inspection backlogs. Excessive fees. Unclear zoning rules.

      <p class="text-large">
        Your story becomes data. Data becomes evidence. Evidence drives change.

        You share what happened. We document it, look for patterns, and take findings to city officials.
      </p>
      <p class="text-large">
        We can't fix your individual permit issue. But we can make sure it counts toward fixing the system.
