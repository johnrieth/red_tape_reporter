  <!-- What We Do -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">What We Do</h2>
    <p class="text-large">
      We're building a systematic record of what's broken in LA's building process.
    </p>
    <p class="text-large">
      Every story gets reviewed, tagged, and added to our database. We track patterns across neighborhoods, project types, departments, and types of barriers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-large mb-0">
      Every two months, we publish reports and share findings with City Council members, journalists, and advocacy organizations. More data means more pressure for reform.
    </p>
  </section>


  <!-- How It Works -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">How It Works</h2>

    <p class="text-large"><strong>Collection:</strong> You share your experience. We review every submission personally.</p>

    <p class="text-large"><strong>Analysis:</strong> We look for patterns. Which departments cause the most delays? Which requirements conflict? Where does the system break down?</p>


    <p class="text-large"><strong>Advocacy:</strong> We publish reports, share data with journalists and policymakers, and make findings available to anyone pushing for reform.</p>

    <p class="text-large mb-0"><strong>Privacy:</strong> Your contact info stays private. We only share anonymized, aggregated data.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- What We're Not -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">What We're Not</h2>
    <p class="text-large">
      We're an independent, volunteer project. We're not affiliated with the city, we can't expedite your permits, and we can't provide legal advice.
    </p>
    <p class="text-large mb-0">
      We can't fix your individual problem. But we can make sure it counts toward fixing the system.
    </p>

  <!-- Why This Matters -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Why This Matters</h2>
    <p class="text-large">
      LA has a housing crisis. Everyone knows it. But complaints without data are easy to dismiss.
    </p>
    <p class="text-large">
      When we show up with documented patterns from dozens of people, all facing the same delays and contradictions, that's different.
    </p>
    <p class="text-large mb-0">
      LA can build the housing we need. First, we need to document what's blocking us.
