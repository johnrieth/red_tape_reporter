  <!-- What Red Tape LA Does -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What This Project Does</h2>
    <p class="text-large">
      Red Tape LA is building a systematic record of dysfunction in LA's building 
      process. Every submission gets reviewed, tagged, and added to our database. 
      We track patterns across neighborhoods, project types, city departments, and 
      types of barriers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-large">
      The goal isn't to shame individual bureaucrats—it's to show city officials 
      exactly where the system is breaking down. Permits stuck in LADBS for 18 months? 
      Zoning contradictions between departments? Plan check delays with no explanation? 
      We document it all.
    </p>
    <p class="text-large">
      Every two months, I publish reports with findings. These reports go to City 
      Council members, journalists, advocacy organizations, and anyone else pushing 
      for reform. The more evidence we collect, the harder it becomes to ignore.

      <p>
        <strong>This is a one-person, volunteer project.</strong> I started it
        because I believe LA can do better. I review every report personally,
        publish findings every two months, and use the data to create public
        pressure for reform.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        It's early days, but I'm committed to this work. Other cities have
        streamlined their building processes. LA can too.
      </p>

  <!-- The Goal -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p class="text-large">
      When residents, journalists, and city officials can see documented patterns 
      of bureaucratic failures—permit delays, inspection backlogs, zoning confusion, 
      excessive fees, conflicting requirements—it becomes harder to ignore the problem.
    </p>
    <p class="text-large">
      I'm publishing reports regularly, sharing findings with local media, and
      making the data available to anyone pushing for housing reform. The more
      stories we collect, the stronger the case for change.
    </p>
    <p class="text-large mb-0">
      LA can build the housing we need. First, we need to document what's blocking us.
